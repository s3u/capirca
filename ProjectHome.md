Developed internally at Google, this system is designed to utilize common definitions of networks and services and high-level policy files to facilitate the development and manipulation of network access control filters (ACLs) for various platforms.

A multi-platform configuration push tool, called ldpush, is available as well.  The Ldpush project and Capirca go together like beans and cornbread, if you're into that sort of thing.

You can find the ldpush tool at: https://code.google.com/p/ldpush/
